# Trello + API Research

Today we will walk through apps such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook
Messenger to get a feel for mapping out applications. Once we have some
familiarity with screen and component maps, we will be taking time in-class to
create maps for your app ideas! We will be spending lots of time using
[Trello][1] in class today - make sure to follow along so that your project's
board follows our design. All Trello boards that we work on in class will be
linked to here.
