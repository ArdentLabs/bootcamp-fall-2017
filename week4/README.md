# Week 4 Review + Assignments

Hopefully all is going well for you in your other classes this week! I apologize
for the delayed homework post this week - it has been hectic for me. ~~I have
made a mistake in regards to the materials from last week's class; they will not
be available to me until next week's class. I have asked Sam if he is able to
upload it for me, but for now~~ Another member of our staff, Jack, helped out by
uploading the file from last week; it can be found on our GitHub page under the
`examples` folder! Here is an example of FlatList:

```
<FlatList
	data={/* An array of data used to render objects */}
	keyExtractor={/* Function that assigns the key prop (must return a unique value for each array member) */}
	renderItem={/* Function that assigns each array member to a React Native Component */}
	onEndReached={/* Function that updates the data once the user scrolls to the bottom */}
	initialNumToRender={/* Amount of objects to render at component creation */}
/>
```

Feel free to ask any questions you'd like on Slack! For your homework this week,
I want you to look into the Microsoft Emotion API and tell me one thing you
would use it for in a private message over Slack. I also want you to tell me how
you would find the strongest emotion on someone's face using the data provided
on their website (you don't need to call the API, but bonus points to you if you
do).

Enjoy the rest of your week! I will see you all in class this weekend.
