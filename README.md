JavaScript and React Native Bootcamp :rocket:
=============================================

 > Jumping into the deep end with iOS/Android development.

Welcome to `P060A`, Ardent Academy's JavaScript & React Native Boot Camp! By the
end of this ten week camp, you will be able to build your own iOS/Android
application using the same technology that Facebook is using to develop their
own applications. Not only will we provide you with the knowledge necessary for
app development, but also some best practices that will ensure that your code is
beautiful and reusable. As the instructor, my goal is to introduce you to the
world of development in a manner that will foster your growth as potential
software engineers.

This will be a rigorous course; learning the course material takes far more time
than we have in class. To get the most out of the course, you should plan to
spend *at least* two hours a week coding, looking through documentation, and
researching new features for your apps outside of class - **five hours a week is
optimal**. If you ever feel unsure about what you should be working on or how to
solve a problem, message me or Sam on Slack!

 > Note: We will connect students to our Slack team on the first day of class.

Each week's lecture notes will contain links to resources to aid you in the
development of your application as well as instructions for the weekly projects
we have in store.

Now let's make something awesome :tada:

 > We reserve the right to move topics at any time for any reason.

 > **Disclaimer**: *Only Macs can natively develop for iOS.* This means that you
 > **absolutey need a Mac** to submit your work to the app store, and a Mac is
 > also **required** to use a device's hardware features (think storage, motion
 > data, etc). This may sound very limiting, but *a great deal of apps can be
 > designed without these functions.*
