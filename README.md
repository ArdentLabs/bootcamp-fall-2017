JavaScript and React Native Bootcamp :rocket:
=============================================

 > Jumping into the deep end with iOS/Android development.

Welcome to `P060A`, JavaScript and React Native Bootcamp! By the end of this 8
week camp, you will be able to build your own iOS/Android application using the
same technology that Facebook is using to develop their own applications. Not
only will we provide you with the knowledge necessary for app development, but
also some best practices that will ensure that your code is beautiful and
reusable. Our goal as instructors is to introduce you to the world of
development in a manner that will foster your growth as potential software
developers.

This will be a rigorous course; learning the course material takes far more time
than we have in class. You will be expected to spend *at least* 10 hours a week
coding, looking through documentation, and researching new features outside of
class. Make sure to communicate with me and Sam over Slack to work out any
problems!

Every week will contain links to resources to aid you in the development of your
application as well as instructions for the weekly projects we have in store.

Now let's make something awesome :tada:

 > **Disclaimer**: *Only Macs can natively develop for iOS.* This means that you
 > **absolutey need a Mac** to submit your work to the app store, and a Mac is
 > also **required** to use a device's hardware features (think camera, storage,
 > or motion data). This may sound very limiting, but *a great deal of apps can
