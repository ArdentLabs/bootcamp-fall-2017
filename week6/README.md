# Projects

Our plan for the day is to translate your screens into code using
[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org). We will be running over the
basics of React Navigation in the first hour of class, then the rest of the
class will be dedicated to project work.

Keep in mind that code reviews are just **two weeks** away! You will not have
time to clean up your app unless you follow good code practices throughout the
development process.
